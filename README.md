# Commute Tracker

A browser based app that helps people get real-time live updates from the MBTA. Users can login, choose what trains to keep track of, and get live updates with timeframes on their trains.

#### Problem Solving Strategy

I thought of the base idea after reading an article about an engineer who developed an app that tracked the new Orange line trains. Initially I hoped to create an app that would provide live updates on how far a train was from a specific station, but the way the MBTA provides real-time tracking information turned out to involve numerous technologies I was unfamiliar with. The MBTA offers a very deveroper friendly API to get on-demand information, so I pivoted to getting service alerts by train.

#### Future Development

1. Live location updates
2. Improved styling
3. Refactored codebase
4. Additional line options, such as Silver line and
